This document provides a number of examples on how to use the **triellipt** package.

Refer to the following sections for specific examples:

- [Zernike modes](zernike.md) — Reprodicuing the Zernike polynomials (a).
- [Boundary layer](layer.md) — Solving the 1D boundary layer problem (b).
- [Pulsing mesh](pulsemesh.md) — Testing refinement and coarseing steps.

(a) This example illustrates the use of the FEM unit with a basic boundary partition.

(b) This example demonstrates how to use automatic boundary partitioning (DtN unit).
