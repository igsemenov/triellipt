This package presents research on an adaptive finite element solver for elliptic PDEs on triangular meshes, with a focus on hierarchically organized non-conforming triangulations. The discretization scheme is intentionally simple, using linear basis functions and constant PDE coefficients within each element. The study explores the connection between this finite element formulation and control-volume finite-volume discretizations, with particular emphasis on handling non-conforming interfaces. In addition, it introduces methods for adaptive mesh generation and develops conservative algorithms for reinterpolating solution fields. See [examples](./docs/examples/examples.md) for illustrations and further details.
